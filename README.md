<h1>Silibrain LLC - Vibesdoc</h1>

<p>Project Description: Vibesdoc is a patient engagement tool for prompt diagnosis using 
patients' case information gathered from a survey & rapid home tests with an AI backend. 
This tool computes the probability of a diagnostic given a patient's case variables leveraging 
large data sets to increase accuracy. Because of the pandemic, we focused first on building a 
solution to help diagnose covid. However, the same code with few alterations can catch 
chronic conditions in development or improve other rapid tests' accuracy for other 
contagious diseases.</p><br>
 
<p>Our covid focused app (http://testforcov19.org) and the core team that made it possible 
(http://homecovidtests.org) remain online and involve in the project at least as advisors 
and believers in the mission.</p><br> 
 
<p>With Vibesdoc's survey results matching patient symptoms with diagnosis, we would 
promptly identify diseases and provide users with suggestions on practitioners and 
institutions that could help them alleviate those. It would also suggest further tests to verify 
diagnosis possibilities and provide selected professionals with a probability estimate of 
such results and an alert depending on the urgency of treatment required. The results 
would also be displayed in an explainable visual manner to help people understand what 
their symptoms might be correlating and help them understand their physicians' 
suggestions, thus increasing their participation in treatment.</p><br>
 
<p>Our team has already achieved success in increasing the accuracy of Covid lateral flow 
assays. We increased the accuracy of tests from 70% to 86% using big data to correlate 
patient answers from a survey to unidentifiable case data. For this project, we would shoot 
for doing the same for other diseases we have researched already. The algorithms 
developed and tweaked in this project will recommend patients appropriately to the right 
practitioner to alleviate their symptoms.</p><br>
  
<p>Deliverables: A React Native app to deploy in Google and Apple App Stores, with a PHP 
dashboard webapp to control it.</p><br>
